Kothrud Police File Case Against Man for Online Harassment

Pune: The Kothrud police have registered a case against a 24-year-old man from Satara district for allegedly creating fake profiles of his friend on social media and posting obscene material, including morphed photographs, after she ceased communication with him.

The man faces charges under sections 78 (stalking), 79 (intent to insult the modesty of a woman), and 351 (criminal intimidation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), along with relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act.

Inspector Vikramsinh Kadam of the Kothrud police reported that both the victim and the suspect were previously employed at the same company in Satara. "Last month, after the woman relocated to Pune and stopped communicating with him, he began harassing her," Kadam explained.

Following her move, the suspect allegedly created fake profiles in the woman's name and posted vulgar comments. Upon confronting him, she received abusive messages, and he threatened to kill her if she reported him to the authorities. The investigation revealed that he continued to harass her by opening multiple fake profiles on various social media platforms, where he posted lewd comments about her.

The victim filed a formal complaint against the man on Monday, prompting the police to initiate an investigation. "Our investigations are ongoing," Kadam confirmed.
