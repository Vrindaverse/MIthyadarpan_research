Woman Booked for Creating Fake Facebook Account of Sub-Inspector

BHOPAL: A woman has been booked for allegedly creating a fake Facebook account impersonating a man, identified as a sub-inspector (SI) in the state cyber-crime headquarters. The complaint was lodged by R. Sahu, 30, from Narsinghpur district, with the cyber-crime branch on Wednesday.

Background of the Case
On November 6, 2022, Sahu discovered through relatives that a fraudulent Facebook account had been set up in his name. The account featured personal photographs and fabricated information intended to defame him. Concerned about the implications, Sahu reported the matter to the authorities, prompting the cyber-crime branch to register a Zero FIR. This type of FIR allows victims to file complaints regardless of jurisdiction, and the case was subsequently transferred to the TT Nagar police station for further action.

Investigation Findings
During the investigation, conducted by Sub-Inspector Raghuvanshi, Sahu expressed suspicion towards a woman from Nishatpura, who had previously been his friend. The inquiry revealed that this woman had indeed created the fake account using her mobile number. Her actions are believed to be motivated by personal grievances against Sahu.

Legal Proceedings
As a result of the findings, a case has been officially registered against the woman for her involvement in this fraudulent activity. The investigation remains ongoing as authorities work to gather more evidence and understand the full scope of her actions.

Implications of Cyber Impersonation
This incident highlights the growing issue of cyber impersonation and online harassment, which can have serious repercussions for individuals targeted by such fraudulent activities. Authorities are urging individuals to be vigilant about their online presence and report any suspicious activity immediately.

Preventative Measures
To protect against similar incidents, experts recommend that individuals:

Regularly review their privacy settings on social media platforms.
Monitor their online profiles for any unauthorized accounts.
Use strong, unique passwords to secure their accounts.
Be cautious about sharing personal information online.
As the investigation progresses, police will continue to take measures to address cybercrime and ensure accountability for those who engage in such deceptive practices.
