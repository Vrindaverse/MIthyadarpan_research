Kochi Police Investigate Fake Facebook Account of City Commissioner

KOCHI: The Kochi City Police have initiated an investigation into a fake Facebook account impersonating Commissioner Nagaraju Chakilam, following the discovery of the account during a routine social media patrol. A formal case was registered at the Kochi Cyber Police Station on Wednesday.

Details of the Investigation
According to police officials, the fake account was created using pictures taken from the commissioner's genuine Facebook profile. Authorities suspect that the motive behind this impersonation is extortion. A police officer stated, “Somebody copied pictures from the commissioner’s original Facebook account and created the fake account. We believe this could be part of an extortion scheme.”

Legal Action
The case has been filed under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Information Technology Act, including:

IPC Section 468: Forgery for cheating
IPC Section 471: Using a forged document or electronic record as genuine
IPC Section 417: Cheating
IPC Section 120B: Criminal conspiracy
IT Act Section 66C: Dishonest use of an electronic signature, password, or unique identification features
IT Act Section 66D: Cheating using communication devices or computer resources
Steps Forward
To assist in the investigation, the police plan to contact Facebook to request information regarding the mobile phone number or email address linked to the fake account. “We are working to identify the individuals who created the fake account of the city police commissioner. We expect Facebook to cooperate with the investigation by providing the required information,” the officer added.

Previous Incidents
This is not the first instance of impersonation targeting high-ranking police officials. Last year, the police arrested two individuals from Uttar Pradesh for creating a fake Facebook account of then-Commissioner ADGP Vijay Sakhare. Several other top police officers in the state have also been victims of similar cyber frauds. The police have noted that many of these cases involve organized rackets, primarily from northern India, which often send messages to the friends of the impersonated officers demanding money.

To mitigate such fraudulent activities, police recommend that individuals keep their Facebook profiles locked. “Keeping Facebook profiles private is an effective solution to prevent such frauds,” the officer advised.
